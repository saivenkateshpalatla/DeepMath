# DeepMath: Neural Network for Mathematical Problem Solving

DeepMath is a deep learning project that tackles mathematical problem-solving using neural networks. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model for solving addition problems.

## Data Generation

The notebook defines a `DataGenerator` class that creates datasets of addition problems[1]. This generator:

- Produces pairs of input (problem statements) and output (solutions)
- Supports various difficulty levels by adjusting the range of numbers used
- Encodes problems and solutions as sequences of integers

## Model Architecture

The core of DeepMath is a neural network model built using TensorFlow and Keras[1]. The model architecture includes:

- An input layer for processing encoded problem statements
- Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions
- A final dense layer with linear activation for generating solutions

This feedforward network is designed to learn the mapping between addition problems and their answers.

## Training Process

The notebook implements a training pipeline that:

- Compiles the model with an Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss
- Uses the custom DataGenerator to provide training data
- Implements early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal performance

## Evaluation and Visualization

After training, the code includes functions to:

- Test the model on new, unseen addition problems
- Visualize the training history, including loss and accuracy metrics
- Provide utilities for decoding model predictions into human-readable format

## Utility Functions

The notebook contains several helper functions, such as:

- `decode_sequence`: Converts model output to readable numbers
- `generate_problem`: Creates new addition problems for testing
- `plot_training_history`: Visualizes training progress over epochs

This DeepMath project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to basic mathematical operations, serving as a foundation for more complex mathematical reasoning tasks.
